    "A class can be considered a template for a new object. It has already been mentioned that many of the types in Python that have been using are really objects, meaning they can have associated methods and hold data. For example a string is an object that holds some characters and a number of helpful methods, for example upper that returns the string in capital letters. When creating a new class, a new type of object can be made from that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using classes, one use object-oriented programming, and this allows the programmer to organize the code in a differnt way than you might be used to. Classes are made to correspond to different parts of a system, and then these can be assembled to more complex systems, while hiding the internal logic of the parts. This is how most modern software is structured, and will be standard for ESS software.\n",

    "First we need to describe a rocket engine. The engine will be used by the RocketStage, and needs no actual functionality, but needs to hold its specifications. The `__init__` method is used whenever a new _instance_ of a class is made, so here we use the `__init__` method to store the information inside the object. Inside an object, one refers to the object itself as _self_, so the information given in `__init__` is internalized by adding it to self. Parameters added to _self_ is called attributes, and if they are added in `__init__`, they are called instance attributes. "
